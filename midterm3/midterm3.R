# Midterm 3

# Write a function called numStarElements. Your function should take the following
# arguments
#   <chvec>: A character vector containing strings of letters, possibly 
#     with the "*" symbol
#
# and return the following
#   <num.star>: an integer indicating how many elements of <chvec> contain the "*"
#     symbol. For example: numStarElements(c('star', 'st*r', '***')) should return 2



# Write a function called numDigits that counts the number of (single) digits in
# a string.  The function should return 0 if there is no digit in the
# string. Your function should take the following arguments:
#   <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and return the following
#   <total>: A single number (the number of digits in chvec)

# Some test cases:
# all.equal(numDigits("1z3p ! 21"), 4)
# all.equal(numDigits("abcdefg"), 0)



# Write a function called hisToTheir that converts every instance of him
# in a string to them; every instance of he to they and every instance of 
# his to their. You can assume everything is lower case. Be careful not to 
# replace words that contain him/he/his (eg. you don't want to replace the 
# with tthey). Your function should take the argument
#   <chvec>: A character vector
#
# and return
#   <theirchvec>: The same character vector with the required substitutions.

#A test case
all.equal(
  hisToTheir("he went to the store his mother gave him"), 
  "she went to the store her mother gave her"
)



# Write a function called mostCommonLetter that finds the most common 
# letter in a string. If there is a tie for most common letter return 
# all of the letters that were most common. Your function should 
# convert all letters in the string to *lower case* and you should 
# remove  everything other than letters. 
# Your function has the argument
#  <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and it should return
#  <letter> The most common letter or letters in the string.
# For example mostCommonLetter("aabbccccdddd") should return 
# [1] "c" "d"
