# The exam has a total of 100 points and for each task 
# the point is given in square brackets.
# The exam has 6 parts and the total number of points by part is:
# 15 pts : Part I, general R commands
# 20 pts : Part II, plotting
# 15 pts : Part III, apply and by statements
# 15 pts : Part IV, functions 
# 15 pts : Part V, simulations

# If you spend about 30 min or so reading instructions and the like
# this gives you 1.5 min per point -- the exam is LONG ON PURPOSE!
# Please just work your way through it the best you can, prioritizing
# things you can easily do and remember everyone else is also
# racing the clock and will be graded on a curve.

x<-seq(1,1200)*3
  
# [2 pts]
# Create [y], a list of length 10 where list k
# stores the output of the k-times multiplication

# y[[1]] is 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000
# y[[2]] is 2, 4, 6, ..., 1000
# y[[3]] is 3, 6, 9, ..., 999

  y[[i]]<-seq(i,1000,by=i)
}
# [1 pt]
# Create [z], a logical vector of length 5000 with entries

v<-sample(1:6,100,prob=c(1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6,1/6),replace=T)

# [1 pt]
# Create [w], a character vector of length 26 with entries:

# For the next few tasks you will use the data frame ChickWeight
# This data frame comes with R so you do not need to load any data.
# To get the size of the data frame type
# dim(ChickWeight)
# To see the first few lines type

#### PART II : Plotting [20 pts]

##### Cars [8 pts total, 2+3+3]

# Use the function [lm()] to fit a regression model of [qsec] (1/4 mile time) regressed on [hp] (horsepower)
# Make a scatterplot of [qsec] versus [hp] and add the regression line to it
# Hint: the regression coefficients are stored in [coef] in the lm object and you can use [abline()] to
# add a line to a plot
fit<-lm(qsec ~ hp, data=mtcars)
plot(mtcars$hp,mtcars$qsec)
abline(fit$coef[1],fit$coef[2])
# [3 pt]
# Make a scatterplot of [disp] (on y-axis) versus [wt] 
# where disp is the engine displacement in cu. in. and wt is the weight of the car in lb/1000.
# Color the plotting symbol by [am] (automatic or manual) (any 2 colors)
# Edit the labels on the x-axis and y-axis to state what the variables are.
# Hint: first do the plot without adding the colors.
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$disp,xlab="weight of the car",ylab="engine displacement",col=ifelse(mtcars$am==1,"red","blue"))
##### We will now use the World Bank Data [12 pts]
load("WorldBank.RData")

# [4 pts]
# Make a scatterplot of life expectancy ["life.expectancy"] vs. fertility ["fertility.rate"]
# The plotting symbol should be a small dot (.)
# Please color the symbols by region (pick any color for each region)
# You do _NOT_ need to add a legend saying which color is which region.
# Put on custom made x-axis and y-axis labels that fully describe the variables
# Add a vertical line at fertility=2.1 (the rate needed to maintain constant population size)
plot(WorldBank$fertility.rate,WorldBank$life.expectancy,pch=".",xlab="WorldBank fertility",ylab="WorldBank life expectancy",col=WorldBank$region)
abline(v=2.1)
# [4 pts]
# Do you see patterns in the plot?  You just plotted these variables for all years between 1960 and 2014.
# Please redo the plot, but this time put two plots side by side (hint: before plotting set par(mfrow=...) )
# The left plot should include only data from 1960, the right one only from 2013.
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(WorldBank$fertility.rate,WorldBank$life.expectancy,pch=".",xlab="WorldBank fertility",ylab="WorldBank life expectancy",col=WorldBank$region)

max.rain<-sapply(rain,max)
    
# [5 pts]
# Create [max.diff.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# __maximum absolute difference__ in rainfall on two consecutive days
# Hint: you can use the function [diff()] to get the difference between entry i and i+1 in a vector 
# and the function [abs()] for absolute value

#   sd (the standard deviation), default 1
#   n (the number of observations), default 1000
#   plot.hist (a logical variable, should we plot a histogram), default TRUE
# Output:

# Output :
#     a matrix of the same size as [m] where if cols==TRUE the columns have been standardized

#    and assign them to be cases, and the remaining m individuals as controls
#    Calculate the value [mean(cases)-mean(controls)] for each of these new samples

# Output
#    A vector of length k where each element is the value 
#    mean(cases)-mean(controls) for one permutation

# Simulate a simplified lottery and return the number of people who share the
# jackpot.

# Setup:
# Each player can pick 3 numbers from the numbers 1 through 19 (no duplicates)
# There are [k] players that buy a ticket.
# All player with the winning numbers share the jackpot

# Write a function NumJackpot with:

# Input

#    B : number of lottery games

# Output:
#    n.jackpot : vector of length B where each entry is the number of people
#                who shared the jackpot in that game

# So in each of the B games you have to :

#    set a counter for jackpot winners to 0
#    generate a ticket for each player in turn, if they had the winning numbers 
#    increase the counter by 1
